# React + Express + OpenAI Chat API Boilerplate

This project demonstrates a simple full-stack setup:
- **Frontend**: React app (create-react-app or Vite)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, acting as a secure proxy to the OpenAI API
- **API**: OpenAIâ€™s GPT (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`), for chatbot or AI text generation

---

## Features

- Secure OpenAI API usage (API key never exposed to frontend)
- CORS configured for smooth local development
- Easy switch of backend port if 5050 is in use
- Includes example for `/api/chat` POST endpoint
